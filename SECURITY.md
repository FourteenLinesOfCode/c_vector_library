## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Vector library, please follow these steps:

1. **Open an Issue on GitHub**: If you find a security issue, please open a **GitHub issue** in the [project repository](https://github.com/FourteenLinesOfCode/c_vector_library). In the issue, explain the vulnerability in as much detail as possible.

2. **What Happens Next**: 
   - I will review your report as soon as possible. Due to my limited availability, please be patient—I will try to respond within a few days.
   - If I confirm the vulnerability, I will release a patch to fix the issue, and I will update the release notes.

3. **Security Fixes**: Security vulnerabilities will be fixed in **patch releases** (e.g., `0.1.1-beta`). You will be notified when a new version is released that addresses the vulnerability.

4. **Public Disclosure**: Once a security issue is fixed, I will publicly disclose the details in the release notes, so that other users know about the fix.

5. **Declined Reports**: If the report is determined to be a false alarm or non-critical, I will notify you with an explanation.

## Security Updates

Security patches will be released as **patch versions** (e.g., `0.1.1-beta`). These updates will be applied to both **beta versions**.
