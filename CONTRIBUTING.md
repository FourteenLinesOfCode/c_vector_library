i am excited that you want to contribute to the vector library. Read all of the guidelines to get started and follow them.

## 1. Code style
- Use tabs for indentation(spaces only for comments).
- Ensure concistent spacing throughtout the code.

## 2. Documentation & Comments
### Functions:
  - Each function should have a comment explaining the function.
  - If the function is complex, add a more detailed comment. Use inline comments for short comments and multiline comments for long comments.

### Comments usage:
  - Please add comments to explain complex logic or other complex things. Just avoid obvius comments.

## 3. Commit Guidelines

  - Start the commit message with a short summary and then explain what you added and what it does.

### Commit once per fix:
   - Make one commit per bug fix to keep things organized.

- Commit every 1 to 3 added features:
  - Commit features after you added 1 to 3 features so it doesn't get messy.

## Pull requests (PRs)
- Fork the repository first.
- Use a [feature branch][git-feature-branch] instead of the main branch.
