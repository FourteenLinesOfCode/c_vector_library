# C Vector Library

A simple vector implementation for c. I also got an example.c file in example/ for examples and documentation

## Features
- Dynamic resizing
- Basic vector operations: push, pop, get, set, resize, and more(just look in vector.h).
- Lightweight and simple to use

## How to compile
- i didn't test it yet with anything else then gcc.
- If you use gcc just do: 
  gcc your_programm.c vector.c -o main
